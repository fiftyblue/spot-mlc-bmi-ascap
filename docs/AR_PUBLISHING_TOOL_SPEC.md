# A&R Publishing Intelligence Tool - Specification

## Purpose
Transform the tool from general matching to **A&R-focused publishing opportunity analysis**.

## Key Questions to Answer

### 1. Publishing Coverage
- **What percentage of their catalog is registered?**
- Which tracks are registered vs. unregistered?
- Are they leaving money on the table?

### 2. Publisher Intelligence  
- **Who represents them currently?**
  - Major publisher (Sony, Universal, Warner, etc.)?
  - Indie publisher?
  - Self-published/no publisher?
- How many different publishers do they work with?
- Is there a primary publisher relationship?

### 3. A&R Opportunity Assessment
- **Should we approach this artist for a publishing deal?**
- Opportunity score (0-100)
- Recommendation: High/Medium/Low priority

## New Output Format

### Executive Summary Report (`PUBLISHING_SUMMARY.txt`)

## Scoring Algorithm

### Opportunity Score (0-100)

```python
score = 0

# Coverage scoring (inverse - less coverage = more opportunity)
if coverage < 25%: score += 40
elif coverage < 50%: score += 30
elif coverage < 75%: score += 20
else: score += 10

# Publisher status
if no_major_publisher: score += 30
if no_indie_publisher: score += 10
if self_published: score += 10

# Catalog size
if tracks > 50: score += 20
elif tracks > 20: score += 15
else: score += 10

# Opportunity Level
if score >= 70: "HIGH"
elif score >= 50: "MEDIUM"
else: "LOW"
```

## Key Changes to Tool

### 1. Focus on Unregistered Tracks
- Highlight tracks WITHOUT publishing as opportunities

### 2. Publisher Intelligence
- Identify publisher names from MLC data
- Classify as Major/Indie/Self-Published
- Flag competitive situations

### 3. A&R Recommendations

### 4. Executive Summary First
- Lead with opportunity assessment
- Business-focused language
- Quick decision-making format

## Usage for A&R Team

cat results/PUBLISHING_SUMMARY.txt

# Check unregistered tracks
open results/high_opportunity_tracks.csv

# Make decision
# - High score (70+): Schedule meeting, prepare offer
# - Medium score (50-69): Monitor, consider for specific deals
# - Low score (< 50): Pass or wait for future catalog
```

### Use Case 3: Catalog Acquisition
"Should we acquire this artist's back catalog?"
‚Üí Tool shows 90% already with Major Publisher ‚Üí **LOW OPPORTUNITY**

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1** (Now): Update output format to A&R focus
2. **Phase 2**: Add opportunity scoring algorithm
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance publisher intelligence
4. **Phase 4**: Add streaming data integration
5. **Phase 5**: Build web dashboard for A&R team
